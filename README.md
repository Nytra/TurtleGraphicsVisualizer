# TurtleScript
A parser and renderer that reads TurtleScript commands from a TurtleScriptFile (.tsf) and then performs the specified actions on screen.

Just a demonstration of a turtle drawing my name onto the screen.

The TurtleScript code for the above drawing.

TurtleScript is a name that I just made up for a scripting language meant for controlling turtles (little nasties that algorithmically make a mess on the screen).

The idea for this program came from a book called "The Pragmatic Programmer" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas (page 63 exercise 5)

The exercise actually only says that you must implement a parser for the scripting language- but of course I couldn't just stop there. 

This program supports multiple colours, navigation in 4(!) directions, and pen up/down commands. You could draw anything from your wildest imagination.
